---->By default what ever we create users for JENKINS OWN USER  DATABASE is suitable for smaller setup where you have no existing user database else where.
---->The other option is LDAP (Light weight directory Access protocol)

Authorization Strategies:-
By default we will be seeing project based matrix authorization strategy with this we can manage the authorization strategy with this we can manage the authorization based on the option available under strategy.
Ex:- Credentials , Agent, Job etc

Matrix Authorization strategy:- Matrix Authorization allows configuring the lowest level permissions such as starting new builds configuring items or deleting them individually 

RBAC--->Role base access control where we can secure Jenkins.

JENKINS PROJECTS OR JOBS :-

FREE STYLE PROJECT:- Classic general propose job type that checks steps serially, followed by post builds steps like achieving artifacts and sending emails notification.
MAVEN PROJECT:- Builds a maven project Jenkins tasks advantage of your pom files and drastically reduces the configuration
PIPELINE:- Orchestrates long running activities that can span multiple build agents suitable for building pipelines (formally known as workflows, and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily fit in the free style job type
MULTI CONFIGURATION PROJECT:- Suitable for projects that need a large number of projects that need a large number of different configurations such as testing or multiple configurations such as testing on multiple environments platform specific builds etc.
FOLDER:- Creates a container that stores nested items in it useful for grouping things together unlinks view which is just a filter a folder creates a separate namespace so you can have multiple things of the same as long as they are in different folders.
MULTIBRANCH PIPELINE:- Creates a set of pipeline projects according to detected branches in one scm repository.
ORGANIZATION FOLDER :- Creates a set of multibranch projects sub folders by scanning for repository.
