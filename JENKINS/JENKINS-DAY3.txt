Ways to Trigger Jobs in Jenkins GUI:- 5 Ways

 sets up automated actions that start a build based on specific events like code changes or scheduled times.
-->Trigger Build Remotely (e.g., from scripts):
  - To use this trigger, first generate the authentication token of the job.
Jenkins Build Triggers
 
1. Triggering Builds via URL
--> Enable this option if you would like to trigger new builds by accessing a special predefined URL.
--> You'll need to provide an authorization token in the form of a string, so that only those who know it would be able to remotely trigger this project's builds.
-- This is most useful when your Jenkins instance grants read access to this job to anonymous users.
-- When that's not the case, Jenkins will reject requests sent to the trigger URL even when the correct token is specified.
 
 Example:-
Use the following URL to trigger a build remotely:
JENKINS-URL/job/<Job-Name>/build?token=TOKEN_NAMEOr:/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN_NAME

 2. Build After Other Projects Are Built (Upstream and Downstream)
---> Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish building, a new build is scheduled for this project.
---> This is convenient for running an extensive test after a build is complete.
---> We need to provide the job name (which is already configured).
 
 Under Projects to Watch, We Have 4 Dependencies:- 4 options
1. Trigger only if the build is stable.
2. Trigger even if the build is unstable.
3. Trigger even if the build fails.
4. Always trigger even if the build is aborted.

 3. Build Periodically (In Schedule)
--->This field follows a syntax of cron (with minor differences).
---> Each line consists of 5 fields, separated by TAB or whitespace.

MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
 
 Cron Syntax:
---> MINUTE: Minutes within the hour (0-59)
--->HOUR: The hour of the day (0-23)
--->DOM: The day of the month (1-31)
--->MONTH: The month (1-12)
---> DOW: The day of the week (0-7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.

	WHERE 1 is for Monday    and 7 is for sunday

 
To specify multiple values for one field, various operations are available. For reference or practice, visit:
[crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)
 
4. GitHub Hook Trigger for GITSCM Polling
--->When Jenkins receives a GitHub push hook, the GitHub plugin checks to see whether the hook came from a GitHub repository that matches the Git repository defined in the SCM/Git section of this job.
---> This option is available only when the GitHub plugin is installed.

5. Poll Scm  
--->Configure Jenkins to poll changes in SCM
--->Apart from the above 5 triggers options or ways we can also trigger jobs manually
---> Total we have 6 ways.
