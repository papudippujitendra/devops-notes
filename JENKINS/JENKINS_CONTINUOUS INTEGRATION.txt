Plugin management in Jenkins:- Tabs

update--->Shows update to pligin already installed
Available-->Shows plugin that are avaialable for installation
Installed--->Display Plugin Installed that have no updates
Advanced--->List configuration of HTTP  proxy allows manual upload of plugin and url of plugin site.

----->In real time we cannot install plugins as simple as that reason being they might be challenges with proxy settings as well VPN in order to avoid we should configure http proxy in jenkins plugin of advance tab.
