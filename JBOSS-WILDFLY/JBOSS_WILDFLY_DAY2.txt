Configurational changes:-

Things to keep in mind before changing configurational changes
1)Where to change
2)Backup
3)How to change
4)Try to do in local environmental(system)
5)Documentation

Snapshot/Backup:-

for wildly configuration snapshot changes
-->Home folder  of wildfly --> standalone-->configuration--->standalone_xml_history  ----->snapshot
filename:-standalone.v1
ex:- port number change
standalone _port change .v2
Need to rename the original or existed file and then replace the customized as per requirement /change

=========================================================================================

Different status of the artifacts deployed in wildfly:-

In wildfly deployed artifacts can have various status states including

Deployed:- The application is successfully running on the wildfly server and accessible to  users.

Undeployed:- The application has been removed from the server and is not currently running.

Failed:- The deployment process encountered an error and the application is not running.

Disabled:- The application is intentionally stopped by the administrator and cannot be accessed until enabled.

Suspended:- The application is temporarily paused and can be resumed later.

Redeploying:- The application is currently being updated with new code and is not fully available while the redeployment process is going.

 Indicating whether the application is currently running not deployed encountered an error during deployment intentionally deactivated temporarily paused or is in the process of being re-deployed with updates

=============================================================================================

Accessing deployment status:-

Wildfly management console :- you can view the status of deployed artifacts through the wildfly admin console which provides a list of deployment with their current state

CLI (COMMAND LINE INTERFACE):- Using the wildfly command line interface you can query the status of deployments with management commands.

================================================================================================

Domain controller and host controller in Jboss (DCHC):-

In Jboss wildfly a domain controller is the central management point for a group of server with in a domain responsible for maintaining the overall configuration and policy

Host controller is a separate process running on each server with in domain communicating with the domain controller to manage the individual server instances on that host machine

Essentially the domain controller  dictates the overall configuration and the host controller execute those configuration on their respective servers.

=============================================================================================

Key points about domain and host controller:-

Domain controller:- 1) Act as the central management point for  the entire domain.
2)Stores the domain wide configuration in a file called "domain.xml"
 { Home folder ---> domain--->configuration---->domain.xml }

3)Responsible for distributing configuration changes to all host can controller within the domain.

Host controller :- 1)Manage the application server instances running on a specific host.
2)Read its configuration from a "host.xml" file specific to that host

 Home folder ---> domain--->configuration---host.xml
3)Communicates with the domain controller to receive configuration updates and start/stop server instances.
